# AVR-AtmegaXX
I2C sensors, OLED libraries, Interface drivers for the ATmegaXX family. 
Libraries for AVR microcontrollers. SSD1306-OLED, HMC5883L, TWI, IIC.
DS3231 RTC, Shift registers. And a Millis() implementation from Arduino(uses Timer 0).

This code was written for the ATmega16, but works on the ATmega2560, 8, and 32. 
And with some modification, the "higher-level" driver software can be reused for other Microcontrollers.
